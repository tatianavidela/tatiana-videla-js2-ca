Level 1 Process
Build a frontend for the API and add the following:
Home page
	• Make a GET request to fetch a list of resources from your API.
	• Create HTML for each item and display at least 3 properties for each.
	• Each item should also display a button or icon. Clicking on this button should toggle the item in and out of an array stored in localStorage.
	• There should be a text input on this page that filters the array of results on one of the properties.
Favourites page
	• This page should fetch the array of items stored in localStorage and display them or display a message that there are no items.
	• There should be a “Clear all” button that clears localStorage (or just a specific key in localStorage) and reloads the display. Don’t reload the page, just redraw the HTML.

Level 2 Process
Add a login form to your frontend that will allow a logged in admin user to perform the following tasks:
	• Adding new resources to the API
	• Updating resources through an edit form
	• Deleting resources
	
Rules
	• Copying and sharing of any code will result in your assignment being given a mark of zero.
	• You may only use plain JavaScript for this assignment, no JavaScript libraries or frameworks. You may use CSS libraries like Bootstrap.
	
Submission
	• Create a folder called your-name-js2-ca, e.g. mary-smith-js2-ca.
	• Add all your frontend code to this folder. Do not submit the Strapi files.
	• Zip the folder and submit the zip file.
